# Your First Application

Ready to build your first web app with Django? You'll need to gather a few things first:

**Your favorite code editor**. You can use Atom, Sublime, Notepad, or whatever editor you prefer writing code in. If you don't have a favorite, give Visual Studio Code a try. It's a free, cross-platform code editor that has rich support for writing Python, JavaScript, HTML, and more. Just search for "download visual studio code" and follow the instructions.

If you prefer a fully featured IDE with excellent tooling for Python, I recommend looking into PyCharm (the free Community Edition is fine).

**Python 3**.  Regardless of the editor or platform you're using, you'll need to install the Python. Python can be installed on Windows, Mac, or Linux.

*Note on Python 2 versus Python 3*: All of the code examples shown in this book use Python 3. I have not tested the examples for compatability with Python 2, and it is likely that the code will not work using Python 2. For a more detailed discussion of Python 2 versus Python 3, I will refer readers to Kenneth Reitz comments [here](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/which-python/) (he is much more experienced, knowledgable, and all around smarter than myself). My thoughts on the matter are captured by the sentiment below from the official Python wiki:
